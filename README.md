# Aim_Trainer

Creating a simple aim trainer using Pygame can be a fun project to improve hand-eye coordination and reaction time for gaming. In this mini-project, you'll make a small window with randomly appearing targets that disappear if clicked within a certain time. This is an excellent way to practice using Pygame and learn about mouse events, time-based mechanics, and basic game logic.
